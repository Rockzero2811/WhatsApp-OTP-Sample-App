# WhatsApp One-Time Password (OTP) Sample App 
This sample app demonstrates how to send and receive OTP codes through WhatsApp Business APIs and how to integrate with our "one-tap" autofill and copy code functionality.

The `Server` folder will help you create a template and spin up a sample server which can be used together with the sample apps in the `Android` and `iOS` folders. Each folder contains its own detailed `README` with more information. 

For a high-level overview, please consult our [API docs on authentication templates](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/authentication-templates).
